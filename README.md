# CreditCardFraudDetection
This project develops a Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Data preprocessing, EDA, and imbalance handling improve accuracy. Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity in binary classification. Emphasis on model coefficients enhances fraud detection and security.
The goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized account use. The dataset includes transaction details such as amount spent, time, and other key attributes.

The first step involves importing necessary libraries, preprocessing data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships. A major challenge is data imbalance, which is addressed through oversampling, under-sampling, or other techniques to improve model performance.

Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification. The model predicts fraudulent transactions as the dependent variable, with key insights drawn from the regression coefficients. Emphasis is placed on understanding these coefficients to improve prediction accuracy.

In summary, Logistic Regression provides a straightforward yet robust approach to fraud detection. The analysis highlights the importance of addressing data imbalance and leveraging model coefficients for better classification, ultimately enhancing transaction security.
